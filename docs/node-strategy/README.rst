Node Strategy
=============


Nebulas PoD Node Decentralization Strategy - Based on the Proof of Devotion (PoD) Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V1.0.1 by Nebulas Foundation, `PDF version <https://nebulas.io/docs/PoDNodeStrategy.pdf>`_

----

Nebulas began it journey with the `Vision <https://nebulas.io/vision.html>`_  of "**Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly.**" With the continued evolution of the “**Autonomous Metanet**”[1]_, Nebulas is proceeding to it’s ultimate goal.

At the core of Nebulas’ PoD Node Decentralization Strategy is the **Proof of Devotion (PoD)** [2]_ Mechanism. This idea behind Proof of Devotion is to provide a measurable value of all users based on the size of their contribution to the ecosystem which includes pledging, consensus and governance mechanisms. With PoD, we plan to not just decentralize Nebulas’ blockchain nodes but to also decentralize community governance via the formation of a representative system and government committees.

Nebulas is building a new **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** [3]_ for complex data networks that will fully embrace community, decentralization and autonomy on a contribution measured basis.

**How to Join**


The new version mainnet Nebulas Voyager with PoD will be launched on Mar 30, 2020. 

In order to best complete the decentralized transition of the mainnet nodes, the Nebulas PoD Node Decentralization Strategy will gradually open the node applications to all. We invite active project parties, partners and community members to deploy nodes and explore the governance processes.

.. [1] Autonomous Metanet: An open collaboration system based on blockchain technology, which is oriented around complex data and interaction.
.. [2] Proof of Devotion (PoD): A consensus mechanism built on the basis of the size of community contributions. This includes both consensus and governance mechanisms. The establishment of consensus committees through community contributors to achieve nebulas’ blockchain nodes decentralization; Participation in community governance through the representation of governance committees.
.. [3] Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): An organization that is represented by public and transparent computer code. Financial transaction records and procedural rules of a distributed autonomous organization are stored within the blockchain.
