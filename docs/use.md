## 4. What's NAX and how to get it?

This smart asset is generated by decentralized staking and is the first token on [nextDAO](https://nextdao.io). Users on the Nebulas blockchain can obtain NAX by dStaking NAS. NAX adopts dynamic distribution strategy where the actual issuance quantity is related to the global pledge rate, the amount of NAS pledged individually and the age of the dStake.

NAX is more closely related to its ecosystem and constitutes a positive-feedback economy. Visit [nextdao.io](https://nexedao.io) to learn more.

There is only one way to mint NAX: dStaking NAS. But there are three ways to obtain NAX:


dStaking NAS and obtain NAX:

* Download [NAS nano pro](https://nano.nebulas.io) to dStake NAS.
* [Online dStaking](https://dstaking.nebulas.io).
* [Offline dStaking](https://dstaking.nebulas.io/#/offline/). Read [cold wallet dStaking tutorial](https://community.nebulas.io/d/744-dstakingtutorial-of-cold-wallet).
