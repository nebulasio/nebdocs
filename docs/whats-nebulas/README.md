# What's Nebulas

## Nebulas: Next Generation Public Blockchain

### Nebulas is aiming to build a continuously improving ecosystem. {#93bb}

Nebulas is a next-generation public blockchain. It introduces Nebulas Rank \(NR\), a new measure of value for every unit of the blockchain universe, like addresses, DApps and smart contracts. Based on NR, it involves Nebulas Incentive \(NI\), which incentives developers with Developer Incentive Protocol, and users with the Proof of Devotion consensus algorithm. Moreover, it proposes Nebulas Force \(NF\), which gives the blockchain and smart contracts within it a self-evolving capacity. In unison, NR, NI, and NF produce a continuously improving and expanding blockchain ecosystem.

There are three technical features: value ranking, self-evolution, and native incentive.

Facing the opportunity and challenge as above, we aim to create a self-evolving blockchain system based on value incentive.

## Principles

The Nebulas blockchain has three major principles:

### Value ranking 

To enable value discovery in blockchain, **Nebulas Rank** measures multidimensional data in the blockchain world and powers the decentralized search framework. 

### Self-evolution 

To avoid the damage caused by forking to the blockchain, **Nebulas Force** enables rapid iteration and upgradability to its blockchain without the need for hard forks. 

### Native incentives

With forward-looking incentive and consensus mechanisms, the **Nebulas Incentive** rewards developers and users who contribute to the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem.
