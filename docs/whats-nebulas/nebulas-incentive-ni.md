# Nebulas Incentive \(NI\)

The Nebulas Incentive includes Proof of Devotion \(PoD\) and the Developer Incentive Protocol \(DIP\).

## **Proof-of-Devotion \(PoD\)**

Based on the Nebulas’ NR system, we shall adopt the PoD \(Proof-of-Devotion\) consensus algorithm. PoD gives an “influential” user of the Nebulas blockchain an opportunity to become a bookkeeper and receive Nebulas’ block rewards and transactional fees as revenue, which will in turn encourage them to continuously contribute to the stability and security of Nebulas.

## **Developer Incentive Protocol \(DIP\)**

On Nebulas, we proposed the concept of DIP \(Developer Incentive Protocol\) for developers of smart contracts and DApps. DIP’s core concept: in the interval of pre-specified blocks, for those developers whose smart contracts and DApps were deployed online during the most recent interval, with a NR value higher than a specified threshold, DIP shall reward them the corresponding developer incentives \(NAS token\), and these incentives shall be recorded on blocks by bookkeepers. With the DIP’s positive incentive mechanism, more and more developers will get incentives to create valuable smart contracts and DApps, which will help to build a positive feedback ecosystem for the developer community.
