Downloads
---------

Bleeding edge code can be cloned from the branch of their git
repositories:

* `Mainnet <https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas>`_
* `Explorer <https://github.com/nebulasio/explorer>`_

Mainnet
-------

`Nebulas mainnet <https://mainnet.nebulas.io>`_ Eeagle Nebulas launched on Mar 30, 2018. It's a basic public chain. There are two features:
