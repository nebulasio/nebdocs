### Thinking in Blockchain
Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly.

### Nebulas Manifesto

>Yes! We Believe

>We believe blockchains are a foundational innovation of the new world. At its essence, this innovation is about the >decentralization of data. People will be empowered to claim ownership of their data through tokens, which will enable data to >be valued and exchanged by everyone on the blockchain.
>
>The blockchain community embodies the values of openness, collaboration, and transparency. An ecosystem created by blockchain >believers is a voluntary association anchored by aligned incentives. We believe blockchain represents the social contract of >the future, and that will lead to a civilization where cooperation, inclusion, and the interests of society converge.

>Blockchains will make life more free, equitable and purposeful. As a nascent digital organism and economic system, blockchain >is fertile ground for creative evolution. It will give rise to transformative ideas and breakthrough technologies. Now is a >time of great opportunity, challenge and hope.

>Do not ask what blockchain can do for you. Ask what you can do for blockchain.
>This is the genesis of Nebulas.
