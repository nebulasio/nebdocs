**Bookkeeping Rewards From Temporary Consensus (DPoS)**
**Income: 8,219.1744 NAS daily**

Time of Duration: Commenced on March 30, 2018, the date that the mainnet was officially launched, until Proof of Devotion (PoD) mechanism is officially launched.

 
Before Proof of Devotion (PoD), the consensus mechanism originally invented by Nebulas, is officially launched, the Nebulas mainnet is employing Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as a transition consensus mechanism. Nebulas has set up a Nebulas Incentive Special Fund to manage all the income arising from DPoS bookkeeping. Such income will be only used to motivate the developers and contributors of Nebulas community ecosystem and will not be sold on any exchangers. We will publish the announcement to the community before using these funds.
